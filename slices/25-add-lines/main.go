// ---------------------------------------------------------
// EXERCISE: Add a newline after each sentence
//
//  You have a slice that contains Beatles' awesome song:
//  Yesterday. You want to add newlines after each sentence.
//
//  So, create a new slice and copy every words into it. Lastly,
//  after each sentence, add a newline character ('\n').
//
//
// ORIGINAL SLICE:
//
//   [yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they are here to stay oh i believe in yesterday]
//
// EXPECTED SLICE (NEW):
//
//   [yesterday all my troubles seemed so far \n away now it looks as though they are here to stay \n oh i believe in yesterday \n]
//
//
// CURRENT OUTPUT
//
//  yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they are here to stay oh i believe in yesterday
//
// EXPECTED OUTPUT
//
//  yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
//  now it looks as though they are here to stay
//  oh i believe in yesterday
//
//
// RESTRICTIONS
//
//  + Don't use `append()`, use `copy()` instead.
//
//  + Don't cheat like this:
//
//    fmt.Println(lyric[:8])
//    fmt.Println(lyric[8:18])
//    fmt.Println(lyric[18:23])
//
//  + Create a new slice that contains the sentences
//    with line endings.
